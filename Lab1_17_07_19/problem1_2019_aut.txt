1.  Write a single general routine to calculate the total kinetic energy (KE) of    a system containing

 (a) N identical atoms with mass m_1 and velocity components, v_ix, v_iy, v_iz
     respectively.

 (b) mixture of two components containing N_1 atoms with mass m_1 and velocity
     components v_ix, v_iy, v_iz, and N_2 atoms with mass m_2 and velocity
     components w_ix, w_iy, w_iz, respectively.

     Calculate the KE of the system containing 10 particles from the
     supplied velocities (File: velocity-data) .

     Submit the code and the KE result.
